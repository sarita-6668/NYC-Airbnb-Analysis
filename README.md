# NYC-Airbnb-Analysis
Analyzing Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover trends in neighborhood popularity, pricing, and room types.
Welcome to the NYC Airbnb Insights project, where we dive deep into the world of short-term rentals in New York City. This project leverages data analysis to uncover hidden trends, popular neighborhoods, pricing insights, and room preferences on Airbnb.

Overview
New York City is known for its diverse neighborhoods, each offering unique experiences. This project aims to explore Airbnb listings across NYC, identifying patterns such as which neighborhoods have the most listings, the most popular room types, and the pricing trends.

By analyzing the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset, we aim to answer key questions like:

Which neighborhood is the most popular among Airbnb hosts and guests?
How do rental prices differ across NYCâ€™s different boroughs?
What types of rooms (Private Room, Entire Home/Apartment, etc.) are preferred by guests?
What are the top neighborhood groups by listings, and what influences pricing?
Key Insights
Manhattan leads in the number of listings, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island has the least number of listings.
Brooklyn and Manhattan together make up 87% of the Airbnb listings in NYC.
The most popular room types are Private Room and Entire Home/Apartment.
There is a notable price difference between Manhattan and other boroughs, with Manhattan being significantly more expensive due to its popularity and tourist traffic.
